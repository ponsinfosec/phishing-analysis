# Phishing Analysis
A case study of a phishing email I received while being employed part-time. I will create a robust cyber threat analysis using five core components: Threat Intelligence Gathering, Contextual Analysis, Threat Evaluation, Predictive Analysis, and Threat Mitigation Strategy Development. 

The goal is to teach beginners fundamentals of cybersecurity and networking by creating an in-depth threat analysis that anyone can understandâ€”even someone in a non-tech role, like my own as an admissions cashier.
