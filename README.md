# Phishing Analysis
A case study of a phishing email I received while being employed part-time at a public garden. I will create a robust cyber threat analysis using five core components: Threat Intelligence Gathering, Contextual Analysis, Threat Evaluation, Predictive Analysis, and Threat Mitigation Strategy Development. 

The goal is to inform and spread awareness about phishing by creating a detailed threat analysis that anyone can understand—even an admissions cashier such as myself.
